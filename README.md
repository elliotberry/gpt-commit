# gpt-commit

_me, at work_

## What is?

CLI tool that uses OpenAI API to generate succinct commit messages with as much detail as possible, using no more than 50 characters. At least, that's what I'm asking for.

Uses GPT-4 model, or whatever you want in config. Entering the command puts you on the hook for about 1/3 cent usage, so make sure you're not going to overdraft on this one before calling me to haggle over a refund.

### Getting Started

1. `yarn global add elliotberry/gpt-commit`
2. Set your OpenAI API Key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`. protip: put it in the ol' `.zshrc`
3. Run the program: `gptcommit` inside a repository folder of your choosing. Make sure you've got some changes staged.

### And then...

The program will prompt for a summary of the code changes and will generate a suggested commit message based on the input.

### Output and what you should do about it

Example output:

```
$ gptcommit
Suggested commit:

"did basically nothing other than update the readme's spelling".

This cost you $350.55. Do you want to use it?
(Y)es, (p)rint, (n)ew message or (q)uit  [default=yes]
```

-   Y/yes/s√≠: will automatically commit the suggested message
-   p/print: will print the suggested message again and then exit.
-   q/quit: will get you THE HECK OUTTA THERE
-   n/new: will smash that http request and ask for another commit message with the same input.

### Advanced Configuration: How to make computers work for you

Under the hood, some baasic opts are described using the `configstore` package, which on posix systems is stored in `~/.config/configstore/gpt-commit.json`. You can edit this file to change the default behavior of the program. Here's what we got:

```
{
    "prompt": "Generate a succinct summary of the following code changes, with as much detail as possible, using no more than 50 characters.\n`",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "debug": false,
    "diffCommand": "git diff --cached --stat",
    "maxTokens": 500,
}
```
### Warranty and Liability

This program is provided as-is, and is almost certainly not good.
